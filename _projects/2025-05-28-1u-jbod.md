1u jbod project

I wanted to add harddrives to my 10" mini rack, but didn't like any of the existing options. I made this bay which will hold two 3.5" hard drives using dell server caddies. There is a custom pcb backplane that the drives connect to and circuits to drive the connection and activity LEDs.
